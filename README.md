# Handwritten-Digit-Prediction
Using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and keras for building the neural network. We created a sequential model having three layer, input layer, hidden layer and, output layer. 
Pre-processing of image involves scaling of the  X-train and X-test for better and faster evaluation. For every input image, we will resize it to our requirements in gray scale, and if required then invert the image also.
